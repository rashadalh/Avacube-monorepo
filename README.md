# Avacube - A functional SDK for working with Avaprotcol


## Description
Avacube is a functional SDK, generated using [Stainless API](https://www.stainlessapi.com/) that can create tasks to be executed as private transaction via [Eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) by [Ava Protocol](https://www.stainlessapi.com/) on Ethereum. 

## SDK documentation
The full SDK documentation can be viewed under the production avacube-node submodule [here](https://github.com/codemusket/avacube-node/blob/main/README.md)

## What Avacube do?
To demostrate the functionality of our submission, we built an example that shows [how Avacube can create a private transaction that sends a specified amount of ETH at a specific time in the future](https://github.com/codemusket/avacube-node/blob/966d02f5d96faf2fee4ad12a5a616591c09e4f03/examples/sepolia-holesky.ts).
